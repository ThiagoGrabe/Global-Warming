 This work is focused on understand the increase in temperature in the world and also in a given city. Then, an analysis for $CO_2$ concentration is performed to have a better understanding about this impact on atmosphere.

Finally, a causal study is made to create not only a correlation between temperature and $CO_2$ concentration, but infer if one feature can impact the other.
